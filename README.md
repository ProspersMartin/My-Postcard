  Created a basic digital postcard with input fields.

## Deployment Instructions (How to Open Project Live)
  This project was originally developed on and run through GitPod. If you'd like to view the page live in a browser, run "python3 -m http.server 3000" in the command terminal. Once entered, Gitpod will give you options to view the project; click "Open Browser". A new tab should open up displaying the page.

## Build / Layout
  The project was developed using only HTML, CSS, Font Awesome (for the Icons), and Google Fonts (to match the Instagram typography as closely as possible).
